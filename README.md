# Mohaba

This is a website designed to simulate the effects music has on individuals in a restaurant while deciding what to eat.

## Description

There are 8 steps in total, as you go through each step you will wait and listen to music which may be either fast or slow paced. How the pace of the music affects food choices is what we would like to study.

The data received is stored in firebase.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
